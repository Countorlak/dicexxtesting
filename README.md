This project hosts a simplistic die roller with a counter. The counter tracks the total of your rolls since initialization or last reset.
Controls on the left include single roll, reset counter, and a toggle to start 5 second interval auto rolls. 

## Why even make something like this?
Way back when I first started to get into programming in JS I saw a lot of people modifying innerHTML. That struck me as lazy even back then. Later on, when reading up on things as I always do, I found out about DOM nodes manipulation in JS. I wanted to take the extra time and effort to try it out to see where it would take me. I wasn't disappointed. I found I could build and place anything wherever and whenever I wanted.
Now I use it for board games and I'm thinking of extending it considerably for Kingdom Death: Monster.

## How to use it
There are 2 ways at the moment.
1. Visit the live github hosting at https://countorlak.github.io/dicexxtesting/
2. Download/clone the repository and open the top level index file manually with whatever modern browser you use.

## Some trivia
This was originally written as a class project for Web Client Scripting which is another reason it is what it is.
